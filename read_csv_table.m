## @deftypefn {Function File} {@var{data} =} read_csv_table (@var{filename})
##
## Read the @var{data} stored in a CSV called @var{filename} and
## return it as a structure whose field names are taken from the
## first line in the file.
## Numeric columns are turned into column vectors, other general
## data types are cell arrays.
##
## This function depends on 'csv2cell' from the io package.
